	<h3>About Me: </h3>
	<div id="aboutme">My name is Goria Salas. I'm a rising junior at Kearny High School and am interested in robotics. In my free time I enjoy reading books while listening to music or binge watching shows/movies on Netflix. I love memorizing quotes from books, television shows, or movies, hence the inspirational quote I have above. I had the pleasure of being apart of the Girls Who Code family and am entirely grateful for the fact that I have learned so much and was inspired for greater things. </div>
