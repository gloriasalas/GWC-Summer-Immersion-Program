	<h2>The best kind of people are the ones that come into your life and make you see the sun where you once saw clouds. The people that believe in you so much, that you start to believe in you too. The people that love you, simply for being you. The once in a lifetime kind of people. - Inspirational quote<h2>

	<h3>About Me: </h3>
	<div id="aboutme">My name is Goria Salas. I'm a rising junior at Kearny High School and am interested in robotics. In my free time I enjoy reading books while listening to music or binge watching shows/movies on Netflix. I love memorizing quotes from books, television shows, or movies, hence the inspirational quote I have above. I had the pleasure of being apart of the Girls Who Code family and am entirely grateful for the fact that I have learned so much and was inspired for greater things. </div>
